# Complete_auth_Firebase_in_Compose

**Key Features:**

1. **Firebase Authentication Integration**: This project leverages Firebase Authentication to provide a secure and efficient user management system. Firebase takes care of the heavy lifting related to user authentication, including user account creation, login, and password resets.

2. **Jetpack Compose User Interface**: The app utilizes Jetpack Compose for creating a modern and responsive user interface. Jetpack Compose simplifies UI development with its declarative approach, making it easier to design elegant and dynamic login and signup forms.

3. **Secure User Account Management**: With Firebase Authentication, user account data is securely stored and managed on Firebase's cloud infrastructure. Passwords are hashed and salted for enhanced security, and Firebase offers built-in tools for managing users.

4. **Password Reset Functionality**: Users can reset their passwords in case they forget them. Firebase Authentication provides a straightforward method for sending password reset emails to users, ensuring they can regain access to their accounts without compromising security.

5. **Seamless Navigation and UI Feedback**: The app uses Jetpack Navigation for smooth navigation between login, signup, and other screens. It also provides real-time feedback to users about their login and signup attempts, whether successful or unsuccessful.

6. **Customization**: Developers can easily customize the user interface and user experience to align with their app's branding and design requirements.

## Getting Started

To integrate Firebase Authentication into your Jetpack Compose project, follow these steps:

### 1. Firebase Setup

- **Firebase Project Creation**: Create a new project on the Firebase Console (https://console.firebase.google.com/). If you already have one, you can use it.

- **Add Your App**: In the Firebase Console, click "Add App" and select the Android platform. Follow the setup instructions, which may include downloading a configuration file (`google-services.json`) and adding it to your app module.

- **Configure Dependencies**: In your app-level `build.gradle` file, add the Firebase Authentication dependency:

   ```gradle
   implementation 'com.google.firebase:firebase-auth:21.0.1'
   ```

- **Apply Plugin**: At the bottom of the same `build.gradle` file, apply the Firebase plugin:

   ```gradle
   apply plugin: 'com.google.gms.google-services'
   ```

- **Initialize Firebase**: In your app's main entry point, initialize Firebase by calling `FirebaseApp.initializeApp(context)`.

### 2. User Interface

- **Compose Layout**: Design your login and signup forms using Jetpack Compose. You can create custom composable functions for text fields, buttons, and other UI elements.

- **User Input Handling**: Capture user input and store it in variables.

### 3. User Authentication

#### 3.1. Email/Password Authentication

##### Signup
When a user submits the signup form, use the Firebase Authentication SDK to create a new user account with an email and password combination. Here's an example of how to do this:

   ```kotlin
   FirebaseAuth.getInstance().createUserWithEmailAndPassword(email, password)
       .addOnCompleteListener { task ->
           if (task.isSuccessful) {
               // Signup successful
               val user = FirebaseAuth.getInstance().currentUser
           } else {
               // Signup failed
           }
       }
   ```

##### Login
For login, use the `signInWithEmailAndPassword` method to authenticate the user. Here's an example of how to do this:

   ```kotlin
   FirebaseAuth.getInstance().signInWithEmailAndPassword(email, password)
       .addOnCompleteListener { task ->
           if (task.isSuccessful) {
               // Login successful
               val user = FirebaseAuth.getInstance().currentUser
           } else {
               // Login failed
           }
       }
   ```

#### 3.2. Authentication State Listener
Implement an authentication state listener to track the user's login status. This allows you to handle UI updates and redirections accordingly:

```kotlin
FirebaseAuth.getInstance().addAuthStateListener { auth ->
   val user = auth.currentUser
   if (user != null) {
       // User is logged in
   } else {
       // User is not logged in
   }
}
```

### 4. Handle Authentication Flows

#### 4.1. Password Reset
Implement a password reset feature using `sendPasswordResetEmail`:

#### 4.2. Sign Out
To log the user out, call `signOut` on the FirebaseAuth instance.

### 5. Update UI

- **UI Feedback**: Provide feedback to the user based on the authentication state (logged in, signed up, or login failed).

- **Navigation**: Use Jetpack Navigation to move between login, signup, and other screens.
